Note: switching to 'be025bf066fd720e53fed43ad7906e4b278e85ef'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at be025bf0 Mark TimeTicks::UnixEpoch deprecated

The variable "enable_ios_corruption_hardening" was set as a build argument
but never appeared in a declare_args() block in any buildfile.

To view all possible args, run "gn args --list <out_dir>"

The build continued as if that argument was unspecified.

Done. Made 14 targets from 8 files in 11ms
